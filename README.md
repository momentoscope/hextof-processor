# HextofOfflineAnalyzer
This code is used to analyze data measured at FLASH using the
Hextof instrument. The Hextof uses a delayline detector to detect
single electrons in position and arrival time.

The analysis of the data is based on clean tables as DASK dataframes.
The main table contains all detected electrons and can be binned
according to the needs of the experiment. The second dataframe contains
the FEL pulses needed for normalization.

The class "DldProcessor" contains the DASK dataframes as well as the
methods to do the binning (parallelized).

The "DldFlashDataframeCreator" class is used for creating the dataframes
from the hdf5 files generated by the DAQ system. It may need to be
modified for diferend beamtimes, whereas the "DldProcessor" should be
more universal.

-----------

To initialize correctly this code on a new machine, run the InitializeSettings.py
file to create the SETTINGS.ini file where local settings are stored.
This is not tracked in the git, to keep compatibility across multiple machines.
